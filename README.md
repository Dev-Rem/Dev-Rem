### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web app that uses openAI to generate a cover letter just by providing a job title, description, and resume.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Python web framework Flask, at the same time to build efficient software.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building software that pushes the world to IoT.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to fund my start-up ideas, so we can make money together.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Django, and React and would answer to the best of my knowledge.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: oluwaremu1407@gmail.com is my personal email.
